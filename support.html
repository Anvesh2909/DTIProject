    <p>The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not. This divide can be seen across different segments of society, including differences in access to internet, computers, and digital literacy skills. People who are unable to access digital technologies are at a disadvantage in terms of accessing information, education, job opportunities, and other essential services. This divide can exacerbate existing inequalities and make it difficult for some individuals to fully participate in modern society. Efforts to address the digital divide include initiatives to improve access to technology and digital skills training for underserved communities.</p>

    <p>Volunteering in the project digital divide among people in society involves working to bridge the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not. This can include teaching digital skills, providing access to technology resources, and advocating for policies that promote digital inclusion. Volunteers play a crucial role in helping individuals and communities overcome barriers to technology access and use, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and connected society.</p>
